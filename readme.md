# Freenect Green Screen
**Status:** Archived

## About
Freenect Green Screen is a utility to use your Kinect device's (Gen1) depth sensors capabilities to only show the image of the person in front of it, simulating a green screen effect behind them. It captures the image with the Kinect VGA webcam and writes the edited frame in the virtual webcam provided by v4l2loopback module.

**As it makes use of Linux features, it's not portable to other platforms in its current state, as far as I know.**

### Current and planned features
- [X] **Virtual webcam:** create a virtual device seen as a webcam by your OS with the Kinect's VGA image;
- [X] **Green Screen:** replace your background with an image;
    - [X] **Blurred Background:** blur your background instead of a image;
- [ ] **Facial recognition:** to keep user's face always in frame, when possible;
- [ ] **Runtime controls:** adjust Kinect's angle, background image and turn on/off facial recognition while it's running;
- [ ] **Improved Green Screen:** replace your background with a video/gif;
